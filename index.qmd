# Preface {.unnumbered}

This web-book is derived from my lecture slides for Epidemiology 204: "Quantitative Epidemiology III: Statistical Models", at UC Davis.

I have drawn these materials from many sources, including but not limited to:

- [David Rocke](https://dmrocke.ucdavis.edu/)'s materials from the [2021 edition of this course ](https://dmrocke.ucdavis.edu/Class/EPI204-Spring-2021/EPI204-Spring-2021.html)

- [Hua Zhou](https://hua-zhou.github.io/)'s materials from the [2020 edition of Biostat 200C at UCLA](https://ucla-biostat-200c-2020spring.github.io/schedule/schedule.html)

## Using these lecture notes {.unnumbered}

These lecture notes are available online at <https://d-morrison.github.io/rme/>.
The online notes are searchable and are currently being iteratively updated^[see the source file repository for recent changes: <https://github.com/d-morrison/rme>].
A pdf version of the notes is also downloadable from <https://d-morrison.github.io/rme/Regression-Models-for-Epidemiology.pdf>,
and the source files are available at <https://github.com/d-morrison/rme>.


### Compiling chapters as lecture slide decks {.unnumbered}

Each chapter's source file can also be compiled as a lecture slide deck, using the 
[`_quarto-revealjs.yml`](https://github.com/d-morrison/rme/blob/main/_quarto-revealjs.yml) [Quarto profile](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/profiles.html) 
included in the [git repository on Github](https://github.com/d-morrison/rme).

For example, to compile [Chapter @sec-Bernoulli-models] as a slide deck:

1) [install quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

2) clone the project repository from [Github](https://github.com/d-morrison/rme)

3) Install the project dependencies using `devtools`:

``` r 
library(devtools) # install from CRAN if needed
devtools::install_deps()
```

4) Render the chapter using the `revealjs` profile using the following terminal shell command:

``` bash
quarto render logistic-regression.qmd --profile=revealjs
```

You can also render all the chapters listed in the [`_quarto-revealjs.yml`](https://github.com/d-morrison/rme/blob/main/_quarto-revealjs.yml) 
[Quarto profile](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/profiles.html)
as slide decks simultaneously:

``` bash
quarto render --profile=revealjs
```

### Extracting LaTeX commands from the online version of the notes {.unnumbered}

If you want to extract the LaTeX commands for any math expressions in the online lecture notes, you should be able to right-click and get this pop-up menu:

![Pop-up menu](images/latex-popup-1.png)

If you select "TeX commands", you will get a window with MathJax code, which is more or less a dialect of LaTeX:

![MathJax code window](images/latex-popup-2.png)

You can also grab the TeX commands from the quarto source files on github, but those files use custom macros (defined in <https://github.com/d-morrison/rme/blob/main/macros.qmd>), so it's a little harder to reuse code from the source files.

### Dark Mode {.unnumbered}

The online notes have two color palette themes: light and dark.
You can toggle between them using the oval button near the top-left corner:

## Other resources {.unnumbered}

These notes represent my still-developing perspective on regression models in epidemiology. Many other statisticians and epidemiologists have published their own perspectives, and I encourage you to explore your many options and find ones that resonate with you. I have attempted to cite my sources throughout these notes. 

Here are some additional resources:
